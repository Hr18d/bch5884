	<title>Welcome to my 1st webpage</title>
<h1>This is my first webpage</h1> 
<body>My name is Hosna Rastegarpouyani and I am a third year PhD student in biology. I joined Dr. Kenneth Taylor's lab in 2019.  In Taylor's lab the focus of most of the project is on <b> the structure of sarcomere proteins.</b> Currently, I am working  on the vertebrate's thick filament using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). <u>The cryo-EM founders were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2017!. </u>
<p> You can read more about Dr. Taylor's research <a href="https://www.bio.fsu.edu/faculty.php?faculty-id=taylor">here</a>. </p>
